# 3 Tasks A Day

This is the first draft of a super simple ToDo-App. The app should help me to achieve my goal to learn to program. I am happy for ever kind of input and help.

## Resources
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for Authentification

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout

[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for Icons

[Bolt Theme](http://www.blacktie.co/2013/11/bolt-flat-one-page-theme/) 
from [Blacktie](http://www.blacktie.co/)


## To Do
- Create a Logo for the app
- Fix all the Problems with the current Theme / create a new design
- Implement Javascript to make task creation & completion interactive
- Write Privacy Policy
- Write Terms of Service
- Make a mobile app out of it
